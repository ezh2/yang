                            The vegetative point, also known as the vegetable growth point, which definition is the
                            terminal
                            cell of a leaf bud or stem from which new growth originates. In other words, it's the most
                            nutritious part of the vegetable. It has the highest vitality, where a large amount of cell
                            divides.

                            For example, the core of cabbage will began forming new leafs, fibrous root of the burdock
                            will

                            Since the texture, the mouthfeel of the vegetative points are often rough and hard to bite,
                            most people throw it away. However, the vegetative points are the most nutritious. It acts
                            as a nutrition booster and a productive fertilizer. The anaerobic composting of food waste
                            can be used for composting vegetative parts of the plants, if not needed.

                        The Pesticide Paradox in Modern Agriculture: <br>

                        Vegetables today are often associated with the term "poison" due to the prevalent use of
                        pesticides. These chemicals and biological agents are essential in keeping pests away from our
                        fruits and vegetables. The logic seems to be: the pricier the produce, the fewer the pesticides.
                        However, organic farming, which avoids these chemicals, is the ideal alternative.

                        In organic farmlands, it's common to see insects like dragonflies, frogs, and butterflies. These
                        creatures thrive in environments free from pesticides. But the reality of business and societal
                        demands means that many farmers, especially those with significant investments in their lands,
                        feel compelled to use pesticides. This pressure has made pesticides a popular choice in
                        agriculture, even though it means these lands no longer provide a suitable habitat for many
                        insects.

                        While small-scale organic farming is achievable, large-scale farms often find it challenging to
                        avoid pesticides. One method to reduce their use is to grow a variety of crops together. This
                        diversity can deter pests naturally. However, manual methods like hiring laborers to remove
                        pests or using nets to cover crops are expensive. Spraying pesticides, although harmful and
                        often criticized by consumers, becomes a more practical solution. It's a catch-22: consumers
                        dislike pesticides but also demand crops free from pests.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Impact of Pesticides and Mitigation: <br>

                        ​

                        The consequences of pesticide use are far-reaching. They can harm the human reproductive system,
                        affecting sperm and egg cells that determine our future generations. In essence, our reliance on
                        pesticides today could influence the health of our descendants.

                        However, there are ways to minimize the effects of pesticides on our food. The preparation
                        method, including the way vegetables are cut, can reduce the pesticide residue. For instance,
                        cutting vegetables into smaller pieces can help wash away more pesticides.

                        Some plants have natural defenses against pests. Tomatoes, for instance, have furry, sticky
                        parts on their stems that deter insects. Ragile fruits, for example, strawberries, are most
                        likely to be sprayed with pesticides. Pest loves the sweet and soft texture of the strawberry,
                        making it precious so that pesticides are necessary.

                        In conclusion, the agricultural sector is a in a dilemma. Both organic and pesticide-reliant
                        farming have their challenges, and neither seems to fully satisfy societal demands. The most
                        significant burden falls on the farmers, who must navigate these complexities while ensuring
                        their livelihood.
